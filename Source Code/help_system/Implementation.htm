<p>The help system will be managed and controlled using Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop application:</p>

<p>Microsoft HTML Help is the standard help system for the Windows platform. Authors can use HTML Help to create online help for a software application or to create content for a multimedia title or Web site. Developers can use the HTML Help API to program a host application or hook up context-sensitive help to an application.</p>
 
<p>The HTML Help Workshop was utilized to create the .CHM file linked through the ‘Help’ menu item in the JMenu bar of the Edge Diagrammer application. This file can be updated to illustrate future changes as well as provide help in adding future classes to extend the capabilities on the types of DBMS DDL files that can be converted.</p>
